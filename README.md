# Spatial database

## This course in spatial databases explored topics such as the PostGIS extension, FME, and MapBox.
The projects completed in the first part of the course focused on processing raster and vector data using advanced SQL queries in PostgreSQL and visualizing the results in QGIS.
Subsequent projects included the creation of a data processing workflow for Sentinel data in FME Form, followed by automation of the process and sharing of results using FME Flow.

### Technologies:
* PostgreSQL Extensions: PostGIS, PostGIS Raster
* FME Form, FME Flow
* MapBox
